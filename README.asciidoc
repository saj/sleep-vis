Assorted scripts used to analyse my absurd sleeping patterns.

Requires an installation of Python 3.7 or later, https://pandas.pydata.org/[Pandas], https://matplotlib.org/[Matplotlib], and https://seaborn.pydata.org/[Seaborn].

See link:parse-saa[`parse-saa`] for the expected data schema.

The examples below were generated using real data spanning approximately six months:

link:plot-sleep-bitmap[`plot-sleep-bitmap`] plots sleeping hours over a wide calendar, highlighting sleeping patterns that diverge from the natural rise and setting of the sun.

link:plot-sleep-heatmap[`plot-sleep-heatmap`] plots a sleep heatmap by weekday, showing which hours in the week are most consistently spent asleep.

link:plot-delta-since[`plot-delta-since`] plots the difference between adjacent bed times.  This plot is particularly effective at exposing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder[N24 disorders].

link:plot-duration-by-wake-weekday[`plot-duration-by-wake-weekday`] calculates sleep duration distributions by wake weekday, providing an answer to the question _How much sleep do I get?_
